          As the Creative Director, it’s my job to make sure that the entire marketing system is
          working in your favor, and to communicate with your throughout the process. My
          main concern is the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’ so we can always be intentional with your
          marketing dollars and creative decisions. I get really excited about creating campaigns
          that exceed what you thought was possible with your brand, and I would love
          to help in any way I can.
